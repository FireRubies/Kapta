# Cards

Cards are the main mechanic of Kapta.

<br>

## Card Attributes

All cards in Kapta have attributes like it's element, tier, etc.

<br>

### Elements

Every card has an element. A card's element is essential in battle as certain elements are weaker or mrore resistant to other elements.

>When you get home look up a chart or something about
>which of the four basic elements are weak or strong
>to which element then finish / redo the below table
>or just include the image you found.

| Element | Anti-Element |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Fire | Water |
| Ice | Fire |
| Thunder | Earth |
| Light | Darkness | 
| Wind | Ice | 
| Water | Thunder | 
| Earth | Wind | 
| Darkness | Light | 

<br>

### Tiers

Tiers are used to quantify the power of a card. The higher the tier of a card is the more powerful it is. The max tier a card can be currently is 10.


<!-- Ask in a discord server about the below math. It seems wrong. -->

>Fun fact:
> It takes 19 million tier 1 cards to make a tier 10 card. Good luck!

## Card Uses
